***NOTE*** Mystique is still under heavy development. But, as they say, release early and release often: if you want to contribute, you are of course welcome. I'd be happy to help you get started. I have some great ideas for this, but of course, time is not on my side (I don't move like Jagger, I talk like him).

README.future.md is a "[README driven development](http://tom.preston-werner.com/2010/08/23/readme-driven-development.html)" document. Not even nearly all of the features mentioned work. So far, the parser and compiler are working pretty well, but there's still a lot to be done. Let me know if you find things useful or want to dive in!

## Working features (more or less): ##
* The tests
* Parsing php 5.3 code (5.4 not yet supported)
* Parsing Metadata format
* Manipulating the AST
* Compiling an AST into PHP
* Compiling an AST into XML
